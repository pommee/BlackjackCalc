### - Calculate the propability of getting blackjack and learn card counting

One day I was wondering what the probability of a blackjack hand was 
and did not feel like googling it,
(as that was way too simple and would make my life way to easy).

<br>By inputting the amount of rounds an answer in median 
and % chance of a blackjack can be calculated.
<br>Streaming multiple games makes for a better answer to the question
and gives a more accurate result.
<br>Multithreading is also an option for faster calculations (sometimes).
